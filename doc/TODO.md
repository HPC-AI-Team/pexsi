TODO List   {#pageTODO}
=========
@todo
- Add support of 64-bit integer.
- Add tree-based parallelisation for the asymmetric PSelInv.
- Add expert user interface for PEXSI for k-point sampling and for spin
  related calculations.
- Better installation procedure. 
- Install PEXSI to a directory under lib/ include/ and doc/, containing
  libraries and interfaces.  
- Option to not to use the history of the inertia counting?
- PEXSI: inertia coutning problem when mu is on the edge. Maybe a
  "global profile". Maybe change shiftMin and shiftMax based on the
  estimated "center" of the chemical potential during the inertia counting?
- Fix the bug for (void*) (see email)
