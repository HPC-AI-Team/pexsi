=========
@todo
- Add support of 64-bit integer.
- Control the output file in a better way.
- When the inertia counting keeps failing, return a nonzero info to make
  the external routine stop.
- Add a routine to estimate the spectral radius.
- (By Seewald Patrick) maxTotalInertiaIter should be a controllable
  parameter in PPEXSIOptions.

- Resolve the conflict in data format between symmetric and unsymmetric
  matrices.
- Add an sample matrix for the unsymmetric case.
- Update the functionality documentation.
- Add the FORTRAN interface for the support of unsymmetric matrices.
- Add expert user interface for PEXSI for k-point sampling and for spin
  related calculations.
- Release of some utility subroutines?
- Software dependence in the config files?
